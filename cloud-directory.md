# Configuring cloud directory
{: #cd}

Users can sign up and sign in to your mobile and web apps by using an email and a password. A cloud directory is a user registry that is maintained in the cloud. When a user signs up for your app with an email and a password, they're added to your directory of users. With this feature, users have the freedom to manage their own account within your app.

</br>

## Managing directory settings
{: #cd-settings}

You can configure the notifications and level of user control for your app. Setting up your cloud directory can be done quickly, as shown in the following image. These settings can be updated at any time from the service dashboard.

![Configuring cloud directory](/images/cloud-directory.png)

1. Be sure that cloud directory is turned on as an identity provider and set **Allow users to sign up and reset their password** to **On**. If set to **Off**, you can still add users through the console for development purposes.
2. Configure your sender details. Specify the email address from which your messages appear to be from, the sender, and to whom your users can reply.
  When you configure your action URL, be sure that you give enough time for a user to click the link. A user must verify their email to have certain options, such as the ability to request a reset of their password.
  {: tip}
3. Determine the types of emails a user receives and the sender information.
4. With the templates provided, customize your messages with your brand or personalized messages. For more information, see [Managing messages](/docs/services/appid/cloud-directory.html#cd-messages).
5. See who's signed-up for your app in the **Users** tab of the GUI.

## Managing messages
{: #cd-messages}

A template is an example of an email message that you might send to your users. You can customize the template by updating the content and layout of the message. You can set these messages to **On** or **Off** in the directory settings tab.
{: shortdesc}

1. Select a **Message type**.
2. Customize your message by changing the content and design of the message. You can use parameters to personalize your messages. Don't forget to save your changes!

### Types of messages

You can send several types of messages to your users. You can choose to send the example message that it programmed into the UI or you can customize the content for a more personal app experience.

<dl>
  <dt>Welcome</dt>
    <dd><p>After they've registered, you can welcome a user to your application via email. To welcome and retain your users, make your message as engaging as possible.</p>
